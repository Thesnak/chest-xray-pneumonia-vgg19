# chest-xray-pneumonia-vgg19

Hey everyone, I wanted to share a Kaggle notebook that I came across recently. The notebook uses a VGG19 model to classify chest X-rays as either normal or indicative of pneumonia. This is an important task in the medical field, and deep learning models like VGG19 can help automate the diagnosis process and improve patient outcomes.

The notebook is well-organized and easy to follow, even if you're not an expert in deep learning or computer vision. It includes code for loading and preprocessing the data, building and training the VGG19 model, and evaluating its performance on a test set.

If you're interested in deep learning, computer vision, or medical applications of AI, I highly recommend checking out this notebook. You can find it on Kaggle here: [ https://www.kaggle.com/.../chest-xray-pneumonia-using-vgg19 ]
